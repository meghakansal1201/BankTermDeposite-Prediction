# BankTermDeposite-Prediction


Coding and Review Exercise: Predicting customer subscription

Overview: 
You’ll find below an assignment to help us understand how you work. There are two core parts: completing the programming task and then presenting / reviewing your approach. 

Problem Statement: 
A bank performed a marketing campaign to track and predict the user behaviour. The marketing campaign was based on phone calls in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not subscribed ('no').
Please implement the following :
•	Perform EDA on the training data (train_file.csv).
•	Implement and evaluate different machine learning based models on the training dataset (train_file.csv) to predict the target and compare the performance on the different models. 
•	Implement the task using deep learning and evaluate performance.
•	Submit the predictions on the test data (test_file.csv)
•	Which independent features were the most impactful on the dependent (target) feature ?
Please Note :  For model creation, performance analysis and benchmarking, use ONLY the train data set. Split the training dataset (train_file.csv) into train and test to create the model and to evaluate the performance respectively. 
Use the test data set (test_file.csv) ONLY for submitting the model predictions.

Dataset: 
Provided are 2 datasets :
•	train_file.csv : Input features and the target feature (y)
•	test_file.csv  : Input features only
